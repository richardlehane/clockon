# clockon

A dead simple time tracker for recording the time you spend working (and not working) on different projects.

Applies bfinn's ["Third Time" productivity technique](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/RWu8eZqbwgB9zaerh/third-time-a-better-way-to-work) of focused working for stints then resting to recover. When you work in `clockon` that time accrues in a bank you can draw from to rest.

Install with `go install github.com/richardlehane/clockon@latest`, copy the binary somewhere in your path, and run `clockon`
